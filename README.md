### Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Kevin Zou

Experienced in Python, Go, and Rust. I'm always interested in learning more about up and coming technologies, and prefer working in the backend of systems and APIs. Very familiar with Terraform and REST API design and implementation. I do lots of game-related programming, like plugins, automation scripts, and mods, as well as game dev.
