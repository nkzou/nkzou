### Hi!ðŸ‘‹ I'm Kevin Zou

I've been programming in various computer languages for nearly 8 years now, and currently most familiar with Python and C++.

I do lots of game-related programming, like plugins and automation scripts, in addition to game dev with Unity3D in C#. I'm always interested in learning more about tech, especially on the backend server side of things.

In my free time, other than my programming projects, I watch movies and TV, follow artists online, and play video games. And I'm a cat person - with a soft spot for Shibas.
