### Hi!👋 I'm Kevin Zou

I've been programming in various computer languages for nearly 8 years now, and currently most familiar with Python and C++.

I do lots of game-related programming, like plugins and automation scripts, in addition to game dev with Unity3D in C#. I'm always interested in learning more about tech, especially on the backend server side of things.

In my free time, other than my programming projects, I... 

- 📺 Watch and read anime, manga, and novels
- 🎹 Play and practice Piano
- 💻⌨ Build DIY Small-form-factor PCs and Mechanical Keyboards
- 🎮 Play video games (Final Fantasy XIV is my current vice)
